This repository contains files related to the dissertation project: **Transparent and Robust River Height Prediction for Rivers in the Oxford Area**, which is housed under the master branch. The data includes information on **river height**, **rainfall**, and **river flow** from various stations discussed in the dissertation.

Key files and their purposes:
- **RiverHeightProcessing.R** and **_targets.R**: These files set up the data cleaning pipeline using `Targets`. The **_targets/** folder contains the output from this process.
- **Results.Rmd**: This file contains the main body of the dissertation and includes the relevant functions for generating plots and analyzing the data.
